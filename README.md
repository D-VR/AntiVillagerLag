# AntiVillagerLag
This is a simple plugin that allows your players to optimize their own villagers and does not effect anything vanilla wise. I am making this plugin due to massive trading halls tanking mspt on my servers and others. This will allow trading halls to keep their twice a day villager restocks but won't effect any farms Villagers will be used in such as Iron Golem Farms, Villager Breeders, Raid Farms, Etc.


## How the plugin works
You name a villager with a nametag that matches the name configured in the yml and disables the villagers ai. If you wish to re-enable the villager ai all you have to do is rename it to anything else. The villager gets restocked when the player right clicks the villager. During this right click it checks the custom time stored on the villager of when it was last restocked compared to the current server time. 

## Please Note

While the villagers are optimized they will not level up at all. The player will need to rename the villager for it to level up. 

## Features of the Plugin

Nametags with the name that is configured in the yml will not be used. This is just to allow easy renaming of all villagers and not have to spend a bunch of resources getting nametags which wil discourage players from wanting to do it. 

Automatically restocks villagers are two set times which are configurable.
